# Dog Meme Generator

> This project showcases a multimedia application to dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote. It is built as a Flask app that uses a Quote Engine Module and Meme Generator Modules to generate a random captioned image.

## Overview

The application showaces the following features:

* Interaction with a variety of complex filetypes.
* Loading quotes from a variety of filetypes (PDF, Word Documents, CSVs, Text files).
* Loading, manipulating, and saving images.
* Accepting dynamic user input through a command-line tool and a web service.
* Object-oriented thinking in Python, including abstract classes, class methods, and static methods.
* DRY (don't repeat yourself) principles of class and method design.
* Working with modules and packages in Python.
* Coding best practices for style and documentation
* Ensuring that code, docstrings, and comments adhere to [PEP 8 Standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).


## Quote Engine

The Quote Engine module is responsible for ingesting many types of files that contain quotes. For our purposes, a quote contains a body and an author:
```bash
"This is a quote body" - Author
```

The module is composed of the following classes:

* **QuoteModel** - An class to encapsulate the body and author
* **IngestorInterface** - An abstract base class for Ingestors that defines two methods with the following class method signatures:
  ```bash
  def can_ingest(cls, path: str) -> boolean
  def parse(cls, path: str) -> List[QuoteModel]
  ```
* **Ingestor** - A class that realizes the IngestorInterface and encapsulates the helper classes
* **CSVIngestor** - A helper class that implements a strategy object that realizes the `IngestorInterface` for a csv file type
* **DocxIngestor** - A helper class that implements a strategy object that realizes the `IngestorInterface` for a docx file type
* **PDFIngestor** - A helper class that implements a strategy object that realizes the `IngestorInterface` for a pdf file type
* **TxtIngestor** - A helper class that implements a strategy object that realizes the `IngestorInterface` for a txt file type


## Meme Engine

The Meme Engine Module is responsible for manipulating and drawing text onto images

This module is composed of the following classes:

* **MemeEngine** - A Meme Generator class that implements the following instance method signature, which returns the path to the manipulated image:
  ```bash
  make_meme(self, img_path, text, author, width = 500) -> str
  ```
